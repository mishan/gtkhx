/*
 * Pure-protocol-parsing helpers extracted from rcv.c / tasks.c so the
 * Tier 2 unit tests can drive them with canned wire bytes, without
 * dragging in GTK, libadwaita, the toolbar / chat / news / xtext
 * widgets, or the worker-thread plumbing that those source files
 * also bring in.
 *
 * Each helper takes a struct htlc_conn whose `in.buf` / `in.pos` are
 * the only fields it touches — the test sets those up via the
 * wire_fixture builder under tests/proto/.
 *
 * The original handlers (task_error, hx_rcv_chat, etc.) remain in
 * their old translation units; they now call into these helpers and
 * keep doing the GUI side-effects (toast, sound, hx_output dispatch)
 * themselves. The shape of the change is the same as the Tier 1
 * extractions: separate the protocol decision from the side effect.

 * Returns TRUE iff a task-error chunk was found and out was filled.
 * On TRUE, *out_len (if non-NULL) is the message byte length without
 * the trailing NUL. On FALSE the caller MUST NOT read out.

 * Parse a HTLS_HDR_USER_SELFINFO message from htlc->in into the
 * htlc fields the GUI then reads:
 *
 *   - htlc->access  — 8-byte access bitmap (HTLS_DATA_ACCESS chunk)
 *   - htlc->uid     — our session UID (read from htlc->uid via
 *                     HN16, since the original code byte-swaps the
 *                     existing field rather than the chunk body)
 *   - htlc->icon    — our chat-list icon
 *   - htlc->name    — our display name (NUL-terminated, max 31)
 *
 * The "uid is byte-swapped from htlc->uid not from the chunk body"
 * is a quirk of the original handler that's preserved here. The GUI
 * sets htlc->uid earlier (during login), and the chunk just signals
 * "go act on the value already there now"; the handler then HN16-
 * swaps it in place so subsequent code reads it host-order.
 *
 * Returns the bitwise OR of every chunk type that was actually
 * recognised (e.g. (HX_SELFINFO_ACCESS | HX_SELFINFO_USER_LIST)).
 * Useful for tests asserting "we saw access but not the user-list
 * chunk" against truncated fixtures.
